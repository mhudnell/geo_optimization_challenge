# geo_optimization_challenge

This is my final project for COMP 651: Computational Geometry at UNC-Chapel Hill. Also a submission for the [Open Problems and Hard Instance Challenges Workshop](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/cgweek2019-workshop/) at [CG Week 2019](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/socg19/).
